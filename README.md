# CIFAR Classification
This example is about the ***CIFAR-10 dataset***. 
It has 10 different categories of images in it. There is a total of 60000 images of 10 different classes naming Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck. All the images are of size 32Ã—32. There are in total 50000 train images and 10000 test images.

We will train a model to correclty classify an image. We will also do some data augmentation techniques to see if it can improve the model's performance.

This example has been run mostly with Google Colab for better computational power by using GPU.
